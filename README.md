### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohammed, former Biomedical Scientist turned Software Developer (thanks to the School of Code) with a love for all things backend!

I'm passionate about healthcare & tech and would relish an opportunity to make a difference.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project at the School of Code, developing a health/wellbeing/productivity app using Next.js.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript (including Node.js), CompSci fundamentals (Big O, Arrays, Linked Lists, OOP, Stacks/Queues etc.) and some Python! Anything to help me to become a better engineer/developer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love flying & hoping to get my pilot's license in the near future!
